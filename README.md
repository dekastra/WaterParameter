# WaterParameter
This repository is used as a repository for publishing the result of research on "The Study on The Usage of Artificial Intelligence To Predict Harvest Time and Water Quality Monitoring on A Vertical Crab Cultivation". The research is funded by The Ministry of Higher Education, Science, and Technology Republic of Indonesia under the Strategic Research Collaboration (KATALIS) Grant. The repository contains the dataset and code used to compare the performance of machine learning models to predict salinity level based on temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH level. This repository contains 2 files as follow:
1. Water_Parameter_2.csv. This file contains the cleaned dataset used for input in Machine Learning experiment.
2. ML_WaterParam_Combined.ipynb. This file contains the code for machine learning proses to learn dan predict salinity level. The code is written in Python 3 using Google Colaboratory.
